# HM-11 BLE module breakout board
Eagle PCB files for a HM-11/JDY-08 Bluetooth Low Energy module, breakout board. Based on the work by [platisd](https://github.com/platisd/HM-11_breakout). 

This board only breaks out the power, TX and RX pins. I added an additional capacitor on the power line.

This board was designed to be an Arduino compatible bluetooth board. See the full story of how I made the board at my [blog](http://westsideelectronics.com/building-a-hm-11-bluetooth-board/).
